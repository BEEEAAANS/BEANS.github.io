NOTE: for all intents and purposes, I will refer to myself as "BEANS" from this blog onwards.

Howdy! I'm BEANS and I'm an English major here at the university with double minors in Communication and Journalism.
I'd describe myself as a fairly average college male. I'm an avid sports fan (go Sixers), I watch [anime](https://myanimelist.net/animelist/ShounenOneTrick)
here and there, I cook a lot, and I'm a pretty casual gamer. I guess the most interesting thing about me would be my [eclectic music taste](https://open.spotify.com/user/a_mild_fever?si=iM7uhNniSUGUYpSOrYSSww).
