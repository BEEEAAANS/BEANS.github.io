NOTE: for all intents and purposes, I will refer to myself as "BEANS" from this blog onwards.

Howdy! I'm BEANS and I'm an English major here at the university with double minors in Communication and Journalism.
I'd describe myself as a fairly average college male. I'm an avid sports fan (go Sixers), I watch [anime](https://myanimelist.net/animelist/ShounenOneTrick)
here and there, I cook a lot, and I'm a pretty casual gamer. I guess the most interesting thing about me would be my [eclectic music taste](https://open.spotify.com/user/a_mild_fever?si=iM7uhNniSUGUYpSOrYSSww).

Aside from needing Junior/ Senior-level credits for my major, I signed up for this class because I wanted to better understand copyediting on an online format. I'm a bit familiar with programming syntax since I was once an engineering major, but the Jekyll tutorial was all new to me. Given the state of society at the moment, with COVID-19 forcing us to socially distance, it felt like the perfect time to learn the skills this class will provide. I look forward to working with my peers this semester!
